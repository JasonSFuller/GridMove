# My GridMove grids

I'm a Linux guy forced to work inside Windows, so I usually have a **lot**
of terminals ([PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/))
floating around.  For arranging them all quickly, I use
[GridMove](https://github.com/jgpaiva/GridMove).  It still works in Windows 10
([with some issues](https://github.com/jgpaiva/GridMove/issues/10)), even
though it hasn't been updated in a while.

I've also ditched my multi-monitor setup for a giant 4k monitor.  I sit close
to it, and I primarily use the bottom/middle of screen with the outside edges
serving the old role of secondary monitors.  Since I couldn't find existing
grids to suit me, I made my own.  Maybe you'll find them useful too.
